/*
Create a function `countChar` which counts, in a given string, the number of times a character appears.

If the string or the character is null, return -1.
If the character length is other than 1, return -1.

Example:
* "" and "a" -> 0
* "a" and "a" -> 1
* "aaaaabbbaa" and "a" -> 7
* "bbacbaaa" and "c" -> 1
* "bbcc" and "a" -> 0
* null and "a" -> -1

Add you own tests.
